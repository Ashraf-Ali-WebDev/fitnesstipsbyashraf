      <h5>Here are some fitness tips you can follow :-</h5><br>
        <li><h4>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Home workout YouTube tutorials </u></h4></li><br>
        <img src="images/img1.jpg" alt="" height="300px" width="100%">
       <p> YouTube tutorials are some of the best ways to get fit at home. There are thousands of free-to-watch fitness routines to choose from on YouTube. Whatever difficulty and style of home workout you're looking for, there will be a video tutorial for you.
Most YouTube workouts don't even require you to have any equipment or let you use household items like a bottle of water.</p> <br>
<p>If you're not sure where to look, here are some of our recommendations:</ul></p> <br><br>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>&#128073;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/YatinderSinghOfficial">Yatinder Singh</a></li>
<li>&#128073;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/yogawithadriene">Yoga With Adriene</a></li>
<li>&#128073;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MadFit">Mad Fit</a></li>
</ul><br>
<li><h4>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Use home exercise equipment</u></h4></li><br>
<img src="images/img2.webp" alt="" width="100%" height="400px">
<p>Use home made exercise equipment as much as possible.Because they are available at your home everytime so you can use them anytime when you need</p><br>
<li><h4>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Stop eating junk food</u></h4></li> <br>  
<img src="images/JunkFood.jpg" alt=""height="400px" width="100%">   
<p>A cupboard full of crisps and a Domino's pizza delivered to your door might sound like the best option when you're on the sofa after a hard day. But, it's not the best for your waistline (or your wallet).

    On the other hand, having a healthy, balanced diet can help you feel much better. It can also improve your energy levels.
    
    Cut out the takeaway meals and snacks and not only will you see the difference in your fitness levels, but you might also lose weight and notice yourself feeling stronger as well.</p><br>
    <li><h4>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Drink water instead of fizzy drinks</u></h4></li><br>
    <img src="images/drink.jpg" alt=""height="300px" width="100%">
<p>You might be pretty on top of this healthy-eating business, but have you stopped to think about what else you're chucking down your throat?

    Fizzy drinks like Coke, Sprite or Fanta, along with highly sweetened or flavoured fruit juices, are only good for two things: rotting your teeth and piling on the pounds. They're also very expensive.
    
    Switch to water and you'll find it's cheaper (even free!), much more refreshing and will help remove toxins from your body, speed up your metabolism and help you be healthier.
    
    Experts recommend that we drink six to eight glasses of water every day to maintain proper hydration.</p><br>
    <li><h4>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Do indoor workouts</u></h4></li><br>
    <img src="images/indoor-workouts.jpg" alt=""height="300px" width="100%">
    <p>Despite what we said in the last tip, the great outdoors can be a massive deterrent to a generous bout of healthy exercise, especially when it's too cold, too hot, too rainy or too dry (or any other excuse you can possibly think of).

        But, don't let that put you off. As well as the workout videos we suggested earlier, there are lots of things you can do in your house, right now, without buying any gym equipment or having to pay for online fitness coaches.
        
        From running up and down the stairs (yes, that is a legitimate exercise) to squats, press-ups and star jumps, you won't have to step a foot out the door to start feeling the benefits of your new health routine.</p><br>
        <li><h4>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Download free fitness apps</u></h4></li><br>
        <img src="images/App.jpg" alt=""height="300px" width="100%">
<p>Using free fitness apps is a great way to keep fit. These apps can help you track your progress and work towards different goals.

    Apps like <b>Sworkit</b> and <b>7 Minute Workout</b> are great for squeezing in a quick session at home. You'll only need floor space and a pair of comfy joggers to get fit with their fantastic (and exhausting) workouts.</p><br>
   <li><h4>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Go to the park for exercise</u></h4></li><br>
   <img src="images/Park.png" alt=""height="400px" width="100%">
   <p>Even taking regular walks outside can be enough to improve your fitness levels. But if you really want to amp up on exercise, grab your running shoes or trainers and go for a jog around your local area.

    Parks are brilliant hubs for different ways of keeping fit. Find out whether there's a local parkrun going on near you (they usually happen on Saturday mornings and are completely free).
    
    Outdoor gyms that can usually be found next to playgrounds are also great alternatives to splashing out on an actual (indoor) gym membership. Loads of the same equipment without the sweaty gym air!
    
    One thing you need to keep in mind is that you'll need to use your body weight more and accept that fitness machines won't be adjustable for your personal body specifications.
    
    Not only is walking or running the cheapest option on the menu, but you can even download apps that pay you to walk.</p><br>
   
   <li><h4>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Switch up your routine</u></h4></li><br>
   <img src="images/switch.jpg" alt=""height="300px" width="100%">
<p>Even the laziest of people can start to burn off some calories by making a few simple tweaks to their daily routine.

    Pop down to the shops for your weekly groceries instead of food shopping online and make sure to use a basket instead of a trolley (work those biceps!).
    
    To burn some calories and get your cardio done early in the day, consider cycling or walking to university instead of taking the bus. Or, you could simply get off a stop or two before your destination. Make sure you always take the stairs instead of the lift â€“ it's the easiest way to get fit for free!</p><br>
